  ##
  # Depending on the current page the link to the cost reports was broken.
  # This seems to be due to a peculiarity of the rails routing where
  # `url_for controller: :foo` would return a link relative to the controller
  # handling the current request path if the controller was routed to via a
  # namespaced route.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  # `url_for controller: 'cost_reports'` will yield different results ...
  #
  # when on `/projects/ponyo/work_packages`: `/projects/ponyo/cost_reports` (correct)
  # when on `/projects/ponyo/work_packages/calendar`: `/work_packages/cost_reports?project_id=ponyo`
  #
  # This is only relevant for project menu entries, not global ones (`project_id` param is nil)*.
  # Meaning that you have to make sure to force the absolute URL in a project menu entry
  # by specificying the controller as e.g. '/cost_reports' instead of just 'cost_reports'.
  #
  # Refer to `engine.rb` to see where the menu entries are declared.
  #
  # * May apply to routes used with parameters in general.
